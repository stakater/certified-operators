                      Requests describes the minimum amount of compute resources required.
                      If Requests is omitted for a container, it defaults to Limits if that is explicitly specified,
                      otherwise to an implementation-defined value. Requests cannot exceed Limits.

                    The pod this Toleration is attached to tolerates any taint that matches
                    the triple <key,value,effect> using the matching operator <operator>.
                  properties:
                    effect:
                      description: |-
                        Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.
                        When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.
                      type: string
                    key:
                      description: |-
                        Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.
                        If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.
                      type: string
                    operator:
                      description: |-
                        Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.
                        Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                        Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                        tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                        TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be
                        of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                        it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                        negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                        If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.

                        useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
